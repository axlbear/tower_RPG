## TOWER - A Turn-based Strategy Roguelike RPG

After hearing rumours about an abandoned Mage's Tower, possible inhabited by a Lich, You, the Adventurer,
enters it with dreams of gold, knowledge and power. But a few steps inside and suddenly everything went black.

You wake up in a cell, your head hurts and you're confused.

TOWER is a project that I always wanted to do, something that would recall those sweet RPG tables we used to play,
also inspired in classics as Gauntlet, Nethack, Rogue, and many other.

This project is written entirely in C, without the use of External Libraries.
